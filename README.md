## Hide Bot Comments
Hide comments made by annoying bots on various websites.

### Currently Supported Websites:
- youtube.com
- facebook.com (comment plugin)<sup><a href="#fb-cp">*</a></sup>

### How it works:
It scans the content of comments for known patterns and phrases. If it finds a match, it will hide the comment. This could create some false positives but should hide most of the annoying ones.

### Issues with certain pages:
<a name="fb-cp"></a>
**facebook.com (comment plugin)**
- Your script manager may prevent this from running on these pages. You may need to remove the Facebook blacklist in your script manager's settings.
